📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a loan application will be Approved or Rejected based on applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, etc.

The goal of this project is to:

Perform data preprocessing

Apply exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Train multiple machine learning models

Compare model performance

Predict loan approval status accurately

🎯 Problem Statement

Banks need an automated system to decide whether a loan should be approved or not.
This project builds a classification model to predict Loan Status based on historical data.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following visualizations were used:

✅ Count Plot (for loan status distribution)

✅ Box Plot (for outlier detection)

✅ Pie Chart (for categorical distribution)

✅ Bar Graph (for comparing categories)

✅ Violin Plot (for distribution analysis)

These graphs helped in understanding:

Class imbalance

Income distribution

Credit history importance

Outliers in loan amount

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

✔ Logistic Regression

✔ Decision Tree Classifier

✔ Random Forest Classifier

Each model was trained and evaluated using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix
